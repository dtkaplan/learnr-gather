Dear `{learnr}` Colleagues,

For the past six months, I have been writing `{learnr}` documents intensively 
for a two-semester course I'm developing for the US Air Force Academy. (You can see the daily assignments 
at links like <https://maa-statprep.shinyapps.io/141Z-daily-digital-38/> and 
<https://maa-statprep.shinyapps.io/142Z-DD-01>, with the last two digits running in a sequence from -01 up.)

The course enrollment will be ramped up from the current 150 students to about 1000 in 2022/2023, so 
I have a big incentive to be attentive to matters like scaling, working with a team of faculty, how students
hand in their work, and so on.

In this environment, it becomes clear that `{learnr}` is just one component in a bigger system that includes tools 
for authoring, grading, publishing, sharing, and management of a large collection of related documents.

I'm writing to propose an online conference where people can quickly and informally share 
their ideas/innovations/challenges in teaching with `{learnr}`, which I've tentatively named `learnr::gather`.

There are some basic questions that I'm going to put aside for the moment, like, "Why not just put together a blog?" or 
"Why not just arrange a `{learnr}` category on <https://community.rstudio.com/> or use the existing `{shiny}` category?" 
I don't have a well-thought at answer to these, but I'm going to proceed as if an online conference is the right
mode so that I can outline some of the topics that I think might be helpful to address.

If you think you would be interested in presenting your take on any of these topics (in whatever mode), or you 
have additional topics, or you think that how to handle a topic is already obvious and documented, or any other response, 
please write back.

Thanks,
Danny

## A few ideas for topics to share ideas and experiences about

1. What is the scope of `{learnr}` for teaching? Is it just for teaching about R, or might it have a larger role to play in education? For instance, my USAFA course is calculus.
2. Course management
3. Authoring tools
4. Submissions and grading
5. Integrating shiny apps
    a. What are good formats for maintainability and re-use of components?
    b. How to style shiny apps for drill-type repetition of related problems?
    c. How to integrate the shiny state with the `{learnr}` state for the purpose of submissions and grading?
    d. Generalizing the lovely state-caching-in-browser capabilities to work with `{shiny}` or other components.
5. Deployment
    a. Managing multiple changing tutorials from semester to semester.
    a. How to integrate `{learnr}` components into static documents. (E.g. a textbook with exercises/tutorials/shiny-apps embedded.)
6. Lay usability
7. Relationship to RStudio.cloud
